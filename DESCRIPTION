Description: A comprehensive framework for planning and executing analyses in R. 
    It provides a structured approach to running the same function multiple times 
    with different arguments, executing multiple functions on the same datasets, 
    and creating systematic analyses across multiple strata or variables. 

    The framework is particularly useful for applying the same analysis across 
    multiple strata (e.g., locations, age groups), running statistical methods 
    on multiple variables (e.g., exposures, outcomes), generating multiple tables 
    or graphs for reports, and creating systematic surveillance analyses. 

    Key features include efficient data management, structured analysis planning, 
    flexible execution options, built-in debugging tools, and hash-based caching.
